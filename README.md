# Customer Support System v1

A full-featured customer support ticketing system built with Node.js, Express, Knex (MySQL/PostgreSQL), MongoDB (Mongoose), RabbitMQ, and Redis. 
This system allows customers to submit support tickets, agents to manage and resolve issues, and admins to oversee all activities with detailed audit logs. 
Includes real-time messaging and robust authentication.

## Features

- **User Management:**  
  - Roles: Customer, Agent, Admin  
  - Registration, authentication (JWT & session), and role-based access control  
  - Admins can change user roles, remove users, and all changes are logged

- **Ticket Management:**  
  - Customers create support tickets (with subject & description)  
  - Agents are assigned to tickets and manage their status: `open`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, `escalated`  
  - Admins oversee all tickets  
  - All status changes and assignments are logged for auditing

- **Audit Logging:**  
  - Every ticket and user change is saved in dedicated history tables

- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  - Socket-based chat within conversations between customers and agents

- **Authentication & Security:**  
  - JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens stored in Redis  
  - Session management with Redis  
  - Input validation middleware  
  - Helmet, CORS, and secure headers

- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  - RabbitMQ for background jobs and queueing (e.g., ticket assignment, notifications)  
  - Modular database setup (supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL with Knex)
